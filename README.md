I am a self-taught enthusiast using code as a tool for solving real-world problems. 

I didn't take the traditional computer science route, I am self-taught. 

Therefore, I don’t call myself a "professional programmer," but I am a capable builder who focuses on what matters to me the most; application.

I use Python for simple data analysis and making sense of messy spreadsheets. I also apply HTML & CSS to build simple websites.

The most important part of coding for me isn't memorizing syntax it's applying what you know. As an adult managing numerous aspects of personal, work and business life, there is barely time and headspace to memorize a lot of code. And let’s be honest, there is AI that can code better than you right now on every level. However, if you understand how to pull together different tools, how to debug code to make it fit what you want and where to integrate it, you can use it to scale up your business fast. 

You don't need a degree to build something useful or to gain insights from data.
